# Queuing-Model
Simulated Queuing Model in R to analyze different set up for a Gas Station

**Description:** Features of the Queuing System
- Customer Arrival - Poisson distribution, Service time - Exponential Distribution
- Multiple Queues (max limit for each queue: Infinite)
- Multiple Serve for each Queue
- Patience level of a customer, beyond which he exits the queue without getting served. 
- Selection criteria of the queue: Shortest

**Programming:** Using Simmer package in R. 

**Conent:** 
- R code used for simulation
- Final Report comparing different combination of queues and servers. 
- Output for each model, compiled in an excel workbook. 

**Key Features Analyzed:** Waiting Time, Percentage customer Served, Utilization of servers, Queue Length.
